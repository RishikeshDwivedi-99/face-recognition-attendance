# Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Face Recognition Attendance System** that uses **OpenCV** and **face_recognition** to detect and recognize faces in real-time. It automatically marks attendance for recognized individuals by matching them against a database of known faces.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 **Real-time face detection and recognition**
- 📋 **Automatic attendance marking**
- 📝 **Logs attendance with timestamps**
- 📂 **Supports adding new faces to the database**
- 📊 **Accurate face recognition using deep learning models**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **face_recognition** (for face detection and recognition)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Pandas** (for handling attendance data)
